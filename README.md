Churn, also known as customer turnover or defection, happens when clients stop their engagement with a bank, such as by cancelling an account, lowering service consumption, or transferring to a competitor. 
To address this problem, this study has examined credit card churn data looking at customer data, such as age, gender, time spent with the bank and churn rate, etc. Methods of analysis include descripitive statistics, machine learning analytics to test the data, logistic regression to predict a categorical outcome based on churn rates, and artificial neural networks (ANN) to recognise patterns between customer characteristics to predict whether a customer will churn or not.  From the analysis that was done,  both logistic regression and artificial  had high accuracy values, with the  ANN  model resulting  accuracy value of 0.93 compared to the logistic regression model, which had an accuracy value of 0.86. The main finding through these methods of analysis showed that important characteristic was a customerâ€™s time period of relationship with the bank determined the leading factor in them churning.
